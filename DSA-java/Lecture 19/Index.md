## Prefix sum problem

Q.1 Given an integer array a return the prefix sum/running sum in the same array without creating a new array



Q.2 Given an array of integer of size n. Answer q queries where you need to print the sum of values in a given range of indices from 1 to r (both included)

// Note : The values of l and r in queries follow 1-based indexing



Q.3 Check if we can partion the array into two subarrays with equal sum. More formally check that the prefix sum of a part of the array is equal to the suffix sum of rest of the array.
